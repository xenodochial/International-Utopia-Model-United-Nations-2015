				<h1 class="part-head opn"><span class="poiret">01</span> - The Birth</h1>
				<p class="lato part-story">The Utopia MUN was an idea, conceived a little over six years ago, with the first-of-its-kind event organised in the year 2009 in Delhi Public School Gurgaon. Over 60 delegates clad in western formals, walked in the school premises on a cold November morning with passion for their cause and enthusiasm in their hearts; in order to put forth their points, debate vigorously, mediate and negotiate upon the issue at hand.<br><br><br><br>
				The delegates participated in two committees: the UN Security Council and the UN Human Rights Council, and exceeded all expectations in addition to setting the bar higher for the upcoming Utopia MUN conferences of the future. Like the United Nations which continues to grow from strength to strength ever since its inception in the year 1945, the Utopia Model United Nations too, proudly expands it's footprint with each passing year, from organising only two committees simulation to organising six committees in the Sixth Annual Utopia MUN conference only last year!

			<!-- UMUN has experienced a multi-dimensional growth since its initiation, both in terms of quantity as well as quality. It goes without saying that the plethora of issues being discussed at the conference has not only expanded numerically but also spread horizontally to cover as many contentious issues as possible. When talking of the history of MUNs in Delhi Public School, Gurgaon, it is impossible not to mention the names of the pioneer students- Gunveen Chadha, Karthik Hariharan, Vrinda Makhija, Varun Thapa Aditya Pattanath,Ayush Kumar, Pranay Mehta, Anupriya Sharma, Grusha Dhawan and Anahitha Sagar, Varun Khera to name a few- who through their tireless efforts and dedication have truly cemented the 
			foundation of Utopia MUN, and continue to be active and proud participants in its growth.Following in their able footsteps, other MUN delegates of the school have been able to hone their skills over the years, and make it a point to share pearls of wisdom with their juniors in ongoing interactions which play the role of a catalyst to help budding delegates grow and outperform themselves with every opportunity that comes their way.-->

				<div class="vis-img part-img"></div>
				<p class="lato part-story princi">With the shared vision of getting participants to discuss global issues under the ambit of foreign & domestic policies, the conference has encouraged grounded and productive policy making. This exercise has not only helped the students to enhance their public speaking skills and make them more research efficient, but has also helped comfortable way possible.<br><br>
				<br><br>Every success story has certain significant contributions that make it worthy of the title. At the Utopia Model United Nations conference, organised every year by the Delhi Public School, Gurgaon; the contributions made by the Principal Ms. Aditi Misra, the teachers, the school support staff and the student community remain unparalleled (and truly form the foundation of its incredible growth and success.)</p>

				<p class="lato part-story princi">Some events shine as a one-off show, some stand the test of time; and then there are those rare events, such is this conference, that catapult themselves into becoming a part of an extraordinary league of its own-marked by exemplary performances, impressive levels of debate and discussion, and the immense hard work of the student body and Organising Committee.<br><br>
				<br><br>The years of hard work, active participation and learning at every step have indeed made this journey special enough to carve an integral place in our hearts; and it gives us great joy to welcome you on a journey so special, this journey we call the Utopia Model United Nations, so, here we are, hosting the International Utopia MUN 2015.</p>
